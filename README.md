# Python Flask REST API
## "How to Build a REST API using Flask"

### Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Ekeoma E. AGU.

In this project, I did a sample illustration of how to build a `Flask REST API` utilizing the `flask-restful` and `flask-restx` plugins/packages - making a comparison of the implementations of the two libraries.

The essence of this comparison is because I discovered that the community support for the `flask-restful` plugin has since been discontinued, and `flask-restx` was the closest alternative; since the user community Forked the `flask-restful` repository and improved on it to create the `flask-restx` package.

To see the implementation for each of the libraries, there are two branch made in the repo for `flask-restful` and `flask-restx` respectively. Clone this repo and run the following lines on terminal to view the branches

### flask-restful

```sh
git checkout flask-restful
```

### flask-restx

```sh
git checkout flask-restx
```

Happy coding
